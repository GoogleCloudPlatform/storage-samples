## Overview

This document shows you how to list VMs having both BackupDR SLT and Backup Plan applied across **multiple projects or folders or orgs** not limited to a single region using a Bash script named `analyze_dup_backup_configs.sh`. This script leverages the [Backup and DR Protection Summary](https://cloud.google.com/backup-disaster-recovery/docs/backup-admin/protection-summary?_gl=1*1tsvrak*_ga*NzkzNTI2MzUuMTczOTQwNjczNQ..*_ga_WH2QY8WWF5*MTczOTQwNDU4Ni42LjEuMTczOTQwOTczNC40OC4wLjA.) feature to view protection summary for supported resources.

**Key Features**:
- **Multi-project support**: Specify one or more projects at once (e.g., `projects proj-a proj-b`).
- **Multi-folders support**: Specify one or more folders at once (e.g., `folders folder-a folder-b`).
- **Multi-organizations support**: Specify one or more organizations at once (e.g., `organizations org-a org-b`).
- **Multi-regions support**: Specify one or more regions at once (e.g., `locations us-central1 asia-east1`).

> **Note**: The BackupDR endpoint takes a couple of hours to refresh, so any mutation would take some time to reflect.

```bash
chmod +x analyze_dup_backup_configs.sh
```

### 5. **Run** 
```bash
./analyze_dup_backup_configs.sh \
  double_configs.json \
  projects project_name \
  locations us-central1 
```
- **`double_configs.json`**: Output file containg the response in json format
